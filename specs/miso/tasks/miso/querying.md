# querying
*making sure we understand the task*

If the task being implemented is simple, just go ahead and implement it. However, if the task is complex, or there is significant uncertainty about important questions, ask the user for clarification. Based on the answers, add sub-snippets to the original specification.

If the query has a reasonable default answer, feel free to document both the query and the answer in a sub-snippet before continuing.
